# Arduino Peer-to-Peer Learning Bootcamp

Welcome to the Arduino Peer-to-Peer Learning Bootcamp! This collaborative project aims to help beginners learn and explore the exciting world of Arduino microcontrollers. Our first project focuses on using Arduino and a switch to control LED lights.

## Project Description

The goal of this project is to create a simple circuit using an Arduino board and a switch to turn on and off LED lights. Through this hands-on project, participants will gain essential knowledge of Arduino programming, basic electronics, and circuit design. We encourage everyone to actively participate, share ideas, and learn together as a community.
